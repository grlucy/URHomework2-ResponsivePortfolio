Questions for TA:
- Will points be taken off for using a header instead of a navbar?
- Why do the screenshots have different breakpoints than the instructions? Which should I use?
- The "980..." screenshots look weird - shouldn't the right/left margins be equal and the content a lot wider? Or should my site look like the screenshots?
