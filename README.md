# URHomework2-ResponsivePortfolio

## Description
This is the site I made for the University of Richmond Bootcamp Homework #2: Responsive Portfolio assignment. I used HTML, Git, CSS, and Bootstrap to develop this portfolio while following a set of specifications and a style guide. I made this site fully responsive through the use of Bootstrap and media queries. It is deployed on Github Pages at: https://grlucy.github.io/URHomework2-ResponsivePortfolio/

As a web developer, I need to deploy a portfolio site that will exhibit my experience and encourage employers and clients to hire me. This site also provides a space to introduce myself and enables employers and clients to get in touch with me.

In rebuilding this portfolio with a focus on responsiveness, I learned a lot about media queries and Bootstrap's capabilities, including navbars and the grid system. I also learned about using Google's developer tools to test site appearance on different screen sizes.
